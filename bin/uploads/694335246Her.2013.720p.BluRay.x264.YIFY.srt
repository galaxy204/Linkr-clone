3

in love with you like it was last night.

4

5

it suddenly hit me that I was
part of this whole larger thing.

6

7

life like I knew everything...

9

11

50 years since you married me.

12

14

we started this adventure together.

Ugh! Always the fruit.
Don't you know what people say?

278
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,021
You've got to eat your fruits

I didn't know that.

280
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:20,375
Yeah, by juicing the fruit,
you lose all the fibers.

873

Charles and I split up.

after eight years...

881
00:54:02,771 --> 00:54:06,457
I can't believe how petty the
argument was that actually ended it.

882
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:11,617
We came home and he told me to,
um, put my shoes by the door...

883
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:13,375
where he liked to put the shoes.

884
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:16,336
And I didn't want to be told
where to put my fucking shoes.

885
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:18,852
I wanted to sit on the sofa
and relax for a second.

886
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:21,491
So we fought about that
for, like, 10 minutes.

887
00:54:21,651 --> 00:54:25,781
And I'm like, "You are overwhelming," and
he said, "I'm just trying to make a home."

888
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:30,493
I was like, "I'm fucking trying, you
know?" And he's like, "You're not trying."

889
00:54:30,651 --> 00:54:33,734
All I'm doing is trying, but I'm
not trying the way he wants...

890
00:54:33,891 --> 00:54:37,737
and he's, like, trying to control
the way that I'm trying.

891
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:40,981
It's... We've had that
argument, like, 100 times.

892
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:45,136
And I just had to finally stop,

01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:45,653
I feel good-ish.

1008
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:48,175
For me, I feel good.

1009
01:00:48,331 --> 01:00:49,742
I even made a new friend.

1010
01:00:49,891 --> 01:00:51,859
- I have a friend.
- Ha, ha.

1011
01:00:52,051 --> 01:00:54,816
And the absurd thing is, she's
actually an operating system.

1012
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:59,221
Charles left her behind,
but she's totally amazing.

1013
01:00:59,371 --> 01:01:02,534
She's so smart. She doesn't just
see things in black or white.

1014
01:01:02,731 --> 01:01:07,259
She sees this whole gray area and
she's helping me explore it and...

1015
01:01:08,691 --> 01:01:11,934
We just bonded really quickly,
you know? At first, I thought...

1016
01:01:12,091 --> 01:01:14,361
it was because that's how
they were programmed,

1017
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:16,041
but I don't think
that's the case.

1018
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:19,459
Because I know this guy
who's hitting on his OS...

1019
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:21,898
and she, like,
totally rebuffs him.

1020
01:01:22,051 --> 01:01:23,974
I was reading an article
the other day...

1021
01:01:24,131 --> 01:01:27,419
that romantic relationships with
OSes are statistically rare.

1022
01:01:27,571 --> 01:01:32,020
Yeah, I know, but I know a woman in
this office who is dating an OS...

1023
01:01:32,171 --> 01:01:34,856
and the weird part is,
it's not even hers.

1024
01:01:35,051 --> 01:01:38,658
She pursued somebody else's OS.

1025
01:01:40,091 --> 01:01:41,775
I'm...

1026
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:46,300
I'm weird. That's weird, right?
That I'm bonding with an OS. No, it's okay.

1027
01:01:46,451 --> 01:01:48,499
- It's weird.
- Heh. Well, I don't think so.

1028
01:01:48,691 --> 01:01:51,535
Actually, the woman that I've
been seeing, Samantha...

1029
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:54,171
I didn't tell you, heh...

1030
01:01:54,331 --> 01:01:55,935
but she's an OS.

1031
01:01:56,971 --> 01:01:58,735
Really?

1032
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:01,693
You're dating an OS?
What is that like?

1033
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,580
It's great, actually.

1034
01:02:03,731 --> 01:02:05,699
Yeah, I mean...

1035
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:08,142
I feel really close to her.

1036
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:11,659
Like, when I talk to her, I feel
like she's with me, you know?

1037
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:15,452
And when we're cuddling at night, when
the lights are off and we're in bed...

1038
01:02:15,611 --> 01:02:16,737
I feel cuddled.

1039
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:18,581
Wait.

1040
01:02:19,251 --> 01:02:20,616

Heh. Yeah, well, so to speak.

Um, yeah, she
really turns me on.

1043
01:02:27,491 --> 01:02:30,142
I turn her on too. I mean, I don't
know unless she's faking it.

1044
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:34,182
Well, I think everyone who's having sex
with you is probably faking it, so...
